C
program that use functions on a matrix:

1) Create two 10x10 matrices Mat1,Mat2 using the next expression:
   for i,j = {0-9}: Mat[i][j] = (offset + i * 10 + j) % 100
2) Compute and show the materix Mat1+Mat2
3) Compute and show the maximal diagonal element between Mat1 and Mat2
4) Compute and show the the maximal Trace between matrices Mat1 and Mat2
5) Copy mat1 right diagonals to mat2 left diagonals
6) Compute and show the transposed of a given Matrix
7) Show a given Matrix
